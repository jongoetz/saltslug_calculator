# Salt Dilution Stream Discharge Calculator

This shiny app assists in the calculation of stream discharge from a salt slug injection (dry or salt in solution) using methods from the sources below.

The app requires a .csv file with the salt wave to and from background condutivity; along with other slug injection parameters.
